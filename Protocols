//  Created by Eric Solberg on 1/11/21.
//
//  Summary:
//  Creates the StoreManagerDelegate, StoreObserverDelegate, and SettingsDelegate protocols that allow you to manage StoreManager operations, handle StoreObserver operations, and notify a listener about restoring purchases, respectively.

import Foundation

// MARK: - StoreManagerDelegate

protocol StoreManagerDelegate: AnyObject {
    
    /// Provides the delegate with the App Store's response, which contains info on valid and invalid products retrieved.
    func storeManagerDidReceiveResponse(_ response: [Section])
    
    /// Provides the delegate with the error encountered during the product request.
    func storeManagerDidReceiveErrorMessage(_ message: String)
}

// MARK: - StoreObserverDelegate

protocol StoreObserverDelegate: AnyObject {
    
    /// Tells the delegate that the restore operation was successful.
    func storeObserverRestoreDidSucceed()
    
    /// Provides the delegate with messages.
    func storeObserverDidReceiveMessage(_ message: String)
    
    /// Stops the activity indicator's animation.
    func stopAnimatingActivityIndicator()
}

// MARK: - SettingsDelegate

protocol SettingsDelegate: AnyObject {
    
    /// Tells the delegate that the user has requested the restoration of their purchases.
    func settingDidSelectRestore()
}
